# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses a traditional server-side rendered architecture with Flask templates. The UI is built using Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and Font Awesome for icons. Custom CSS provides a futuristic theme with dark backgrounds, neon accents, and animated elements. JavaScript handles form interactions, AJAX requests, and UI enhancements like tooltips and button animations.

### Module System
- **Football Module**: Complete league management with table display, statistics, and export features
- **Music Module**: Placeholder for Spotify integration and playlist management
- **Movies Module**: Placeholder for TMDB integration and movie catalog
- **Apps MOD Module**: Placeholder for APK management and distribution system

### Navigation System
- Dropdown menus for easy module access
- Admin-specific navigation with logs and system management
- Responsive design compatible with mobile and desktop

## Backend Architecture
The backend follows a standard Flask MVC pattern with separation of concerns:
- **app.py**: Main application configuration and initialization
- **routes.py**: Request handlers and business logic for all modules
- **models.py**: Database models and data access layer
- **templates/**: Jinja2 templates organized by modules and admin sections
- **static/**: CSS, JavaScript, and asset files with module-specific organization

### Key Features Implemented
- **Authentication & Security**: Session-based auth with password hashing and admin privileges
- **Module System**: Independent modules for each service category with dedicated templates
- **API Management**: Full CRUD operations for API keys with connection testing
- **Data Export**: CSV and JSON export functionality with API key validation
- **System Monitoring**: Activity logs, update history, and system status tracking
- **RESTful API**: External API endpoints for integration with other applications
- **Private Football API**: Complete API system with real Liga MX data scraping
- **Personal API Keys**: Individual API key generation and management for users
- **Web Scraping**: Real-time data extraction from ESPN and Liga MX sources

The application uses Flask-SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations and includes comprehensive error handling and logging.

## Data Storage
The system uses SQLAlchemy with a flexible database configuration that defaults to SQLite for development but can be configured for production databases via environment variables. Three main entities are modeled:
- **User**: Handles authentication, authorization, and user management
- **ApiKey**: Stores API credentials for various external services
- **WebsiteControl**: Manages website configurations and their associated API keys

The schema includes proper relationships between entities and tracks metadata like creation timestamps and last update times.

## Authentication & Authorization
Authentication is handled through Flask sessions with secure password hashing. The system includes role-based access control with admin privileges for advanced functionality. Session management tracks user login state and includes security features like session secrets and proxy fix middleware for deployment behind reverse proxies.
